# Functional Programming Principles

The purpose of this repo is to offer a nice summary of the functional programming principles following a practical approach using Scala as the main programming language (that is not purely functional, but encapsulated most of the principles).
I attended two Coursera courses that I link below in the credits, so in each folder, you can find a quick summary of each lesson and the exercise-related to them solved.
Note: I had serious difficulties attending those two courses because they're assuming a basic knowledge of functional programming. So once started, I had to step back and read a book from Alvin Alexander called "functional programming simplified", to get the concepts. Once finished, I come back to the two courses and I completed them. You can find in the folders some concepts from this book. What I can say is that the courses on Coursera were too formal with math formalisms, instead, the book was the exact opposite, maybe too pragmatic in the explanations, so I recommend both the resources to have both concepts related the functional programming.
